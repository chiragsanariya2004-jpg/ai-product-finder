<h2>Key Camera Features You Must Check</h2>

<h3>1. Sensor Size Matters More Than Megapixels</h3>
<p>Many people focus only on megapixels, but sensor size plays a bigger role. A larger sensor captures more light, resulting in better dynamic range and improved low-light performance.</p>

<h3>2. Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)</h3>
<p>OIS reduces blur and shake while taking photos or recording videos. If you want sharp night photos and stable videos, OIS is extremely important.</p>

<h3>3. Night Mode Performance</h3>
<p>A good night mode uses AI and long exposure techniques to brighten dark scenes without too much noise.</p>

<h3>4. Ultra-Wide Camera</h3>
<p>For landscape and group photography, an ultra-wide lens is essential.</p>

<h3>5. Video Recording Capabilities</h3>
<p>If you create reels or YouTube videos, make sure the phone supports 4K recording with stabilization.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sharp details</li>
